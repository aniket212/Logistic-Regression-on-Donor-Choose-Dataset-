# Logistic-Regression-on-Donor-Choose-Dataset-
Founded in 2000 by a high school teacher in the Bronx, DonorsChoose.org empowers public school teachers from across the country to request much-needed materials and experiences for their students. At any given time, there are thousands of classroom requests that can be brought to life with a gift of any amount.  DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org.

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.The dataset contains information from teachers' project applications to DonorsChoose.org including teacher attributes, school attributes, and the project proposals including application essays. My objective was to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved.
